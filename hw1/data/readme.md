##data

This folder contains the original data used to complete HW for Stat 679.
Data was originally downloaded from the main course repo:
https://github.com/UWMadison-computingtools/coursedata/tree/master/hw1-snaqTimeTests

Files here have been changed to reflect HW1 Exercise 1, where we changed the
.log files from timetest1, timetest2, ..., timetest9 to timetest01,
timetest02,..., timetest09.

If starting from the original files, the script 'normalizeFileNames.sh' (located in hw1/scripts/) can be
run to reflect the name changes seen here.

All files for HW1 should be run from the main directory, 'hw1'

The two folders, __log__ and __out__ house the .log and .out files
respectively.
